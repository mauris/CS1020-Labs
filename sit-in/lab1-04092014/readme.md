## Commentaries

For this lab, 3 marks was deducted for not writing the Pre and Post Conditions correctly. You may read the marker's comments in the code.

Generally, pre-conditions are the conditions needed to be satisfied before you can run this method. 

> e.g. the linked list needs to be initialised before you can work with it.

As for post-conditions, you can describe what happens after calling this method.

> e.g. The new node is inserted into the tree. 

But the most important part is to document and accurately describe your method and what it does. Description, Pre-Cond and Post-Cond should follow this format:

    /**
     * {{Description}}
     * Pre-Cond:  {{Pre-Cond}}
     * Post-Cond: {{Post-Cond}}
     */
    public void someAwesomeMethod()
    {
        // do something pls
    }
