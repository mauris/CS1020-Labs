##Introduction

Hello there! I took CS1020 at NUS SoC in my first semester (AY2014/15 Sem 1). Herein contains my solution to the sit-in labs, (some) take home labs and practice PEs.  Hope it can help others.

##Rules

- All these code I've written will are released public under the MIT License
- Do not ask me for my answers for those I did not upload. Either I did not do those exercises or I do not have them.
- Do not ask me to provide the test data and question paper (which are IP of NUS).
- If you have a question on any of my code, you can create a new Issue, with reference to the lab, file and line number in the description.
