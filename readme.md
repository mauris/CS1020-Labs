##Introduction

Hello there! I took CS1020 at NUS SoC in my first semester (AY2014/15 Sem 1). Herein contains my solution to the sit-in labs, (some) take home labs and practice PEs.  Hope it can help others.

>Disclaimer: I do not claim to have written perfect code that is considered as the only solution to the problems posted. There are other better, shorter, faster and more elegant solutions. If you had written them, I urge you to share it (if willing). 

For the sit-in labs, there are other question papers which I did not attempt (morning/afternoon sessions). I do not have access to those question papers and I do not have the solution to them.

##Rules

- All these code and commentaries I've written in this repository are released under the MIT License. 
- DO NOT submit my answer as yours in your graded labs. Doubt any of the labs were repeated before. (new question paper and test data every single time). 
- Do not ask me for my answers for those I did not upload. Either I did not do those exercises or I do not have them.
- Do not ask me to provide the test data and question paper (which are IP of NUS).
- If you have a question on any of my code, you can create a new Issue, with reference to the lab, file and line number in the description.
